This is a repository containing some snippets of C and C++ codes I wrote earlier. Some code are not mine. In this case, they contain original comments by the original writer.

Some may have some dependency on Windows OS and 32 bits architecture which I primarly used when writing those codes :)

Some may not work also due to dependency on some C/C++ implementation but I will correct when I find them after the first commit.

TODO
====

- Group similar snippets into libraries
- Remove duplicate code
- Port to other OS and architecture
- Optimize algorithms (most use naive approach)
- Describe each snippet in a central point (README or Wiki)
- Add READMEs to individual forlder for each project
- Add Makefile if needed
